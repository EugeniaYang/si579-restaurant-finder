# Getting Started with our Restaurant Finder

This project is our group final project for SI579 Building Interactive Applications at UMSI. Based on our interest in
eating in good restaurants, and the need to find good restaurants when we travel, we designed and developed this
application to make things easier for those who are planning for a travel or just a great dinner.
